Hi Pythonistas, 

and welcome to our repository! 

Hope you find our talk at PyCon Sweden 2022 interesting and now you are hungry to discover more about Watson NLP Python Library. 
Here you will find instructions that will take you forward to start your project in IBM Watson Studio where Watson NLP is generally available. 

We identify 4 personas who have different scenarios of how they get access to Watson NLP. 
In this repository, we will mostly concentrate on Watson NLP for data scientists, as Watson NLP is a generally available library in Watson Studio. 

Also, we will leave some links with documentation where you can call Watson NLP API or consider using Watson NLP as an ISV.
